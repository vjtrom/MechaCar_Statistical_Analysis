## Linear Regression to Predict MPG
![](https://github.com/vjtrom/MechaCar_Statistical_Analysis/blob/main/images/LM%20MechaCar_mpg.jpg)

**Which variables/coefficients provided a non-random amount of variance to the mpg values in the dataset?**
 - According to our results, vehicle_length and ground_clearance (as well as intercept) are statistically unlikely to provide random amounts of variance to the linear model. 

**Is the slope of the linear model considered to be zero? Why or why not?**
- No, because some of the variables such as vehicle_length, ground clearance and AWD have a beta coefficient greater or less than zero

**Does this linear model predict mpg of MechaCar prototypes effectively? Why or why not?**
- Yes, becuase the Multiple-Squared and Adusted R-Squared are 71% and 68% respectively, meaning the model is predictive
